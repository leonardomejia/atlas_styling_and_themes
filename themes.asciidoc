= Creating a Theme

Atlas uses themes to style projects. Each theme is built with CSS and split into 4 pieces, for each of the different output formats: PDF, EPUB, MOBI, and HTML. 

A new theme should include the following:

* pdf.css
* epub.css
* mobi.css
* html.css
* theme.json (required)
* sample images (at least 1 required)
* sample files (optional)

== Theme Information

Every theme must include a theme.json file that includes information about the theme, as follows:

* Theme name
* Creator
* Description
* Path to screenshots of the theme
* Path to sample files using the theme
